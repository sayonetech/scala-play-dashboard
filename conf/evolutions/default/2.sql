--
-- The winery Allée Bleue in the picturesque Franschhoek valley is one of the oldest wineries in South Africa. Tradition and the pride in South African wine make the vineyard so special. The winemaker Van Zyl Du Toit has already made a name for himself in the wine world at Simonsig with the awarded Cap Classique wines. He is now dedicated to one objective at Allée Bleue: making typical South African wine of the highest quality. Especially the grape varieties Pinotage and Chenin Blanc are dear to his heart, as they carry the attitude towards life and the flavour finesse of South Africa within them like no other vines do. Despite being no Chenin Blanc but a cuvee from Chardonnay, Sémillon and Viognier, the white wine Isabeau is considered to be the winery’s flagship. Not for nothing, as due to its rich aromas and fruity taste it belongs to the Top 100 wines of the country.
-- The Family Dauphin from Allée Bleue
-- Allée Bleue has been owned by Friedrich-Wilhelm Dauphin for several years now; before that he has internationally succeeded with his high quality and stylish office furniture. The ongoing passion for the Wineland South Africa has led him and his wife to follow this passion with excellent premium wines at Allée Bleue. Due to an extraordinarily high personal commitment these two succeeded in that, together with their excellent team. Every individual sip is brim-full of the love for the country and its culinary possibilities.
-- Allée Bleue has an artistic Focus
-- Wines from Allée Bleue are true pieces of art in wine production. No wonder that the family Dauphin also devotes its time to artistic aspects and establishes such a focus for their estate. Emil Sogor, the renowned artist who is well-versed in many areas and who creates in the space between graphics, design, painting and sculpture gives the winery a very special look. His pieces are exhibited all over the yard and feature drawings, paintings and sculptures alike. He was successful in creating a bridge between the breathtaking landscape, the tradition of the winery and the modern 21st century at Allée Bleue. And all this with an elegance that is by no means inferior to the wines of the estate.

--
-- The wine farm L’ Ormarins is located on the foothills of the mighty Groot Drakenstein Mountains in the picturesque Franschhoek. Since 1969, it has been in possession of the family Rupert; it is even more inseparably connected with Anthonij Rupert Wines today and has become the undisputed heart. Besides L’ Ormarins, there are three other farms that belong to Anthonij Rupert Wines: Altima, Riebeeksriver and Rooderust. Through their different locations, it is possible to provide the ideal growth conditions for each grape variety and consciously emphasize the best features of the different vines. This is how Johann Rupert managed to create an impressive memorial for his brother with Anthonij Rupert Wines which continues to live his claim to produce excellent wines every day.
-- Back to the Beginnings...
-- The winery L’ Ormarins can look back on a long history which in today’s time can be noticed in many areas. The name alone gives away the founding through the French Huguenot Jean Roi in 1694 who named the land after his home Lourmarin in France. He had been cultivating vines on the impressive slopes of the Drakenstein Valley yet the great orchards were also an important pillar. Until the purchase by Dr. Anton Rupert in 1969, L’ Ormarins had often changed owners and had increasingly focused on viniculture. In 1833, it had even produced the first South African champion white wine and brandy but only under the family Rupert, especially under Anton Rupert’s son Anthonij, the winery finally managed to permanently create noble top class wines.
-- ...and yet Discover New Possibilities
-- Under this guiding principle, Jean Roi had already laid the cornerstones for excellent wine production of Anthonij Rupert Wines. This can especially be seen in the historic cellar that can now be admired again in its original state after laborious restoration. Previously, families living in the surrounding areas brought their own grapes in order to let their wine mature there. The coats of arms on the large, old oak barrels confirm this old tradition that had meant a huge innovation at that time. The new Anthonij Rupert cellar was finished in 2005 and houses state-of-the-art technology and works with gravity supported technology. However, when it comes to selecting the wines, good old manual labour is still used – this is how Anthonij Rupert Wines successfully, as numerous international awards show, unites old tradition with modern cellar technology.

--
-- Almost right from the beginning in the history of the South African wine estate Avontuur, there were two hearts beating. On the one hand, there is the extraordinary high quality premium wine of the yard that has caused a stir in the international wine world due to its numerous awards. On the other hand, there is the horse breeding of the owner who has won some races with his horses, amongst others the famous Durban July. The former tobacco trader Tony Taberer bought the farm in 1983 and added the horse breeding in 1987. Both aspects of Avontuur are combined on the wines’ labels. They always show one of the glorious and award-winning horses. Some of the high class wines even carry the names of the animals, such as the Baccarat or the Dominion Royale.
-- Perfect Location for Premium Wine
-- Avontuur is situated at the Helderberg between the two regions Somerset West and Stellenbosch. The nutrient soils, a fantastic microclimate at the vines as well as the perfect mix of rain and sun makes the winery an ideal place for the cultivation of premium vines of international standing. The yard covers more than 100 hectares of cultivation area on which wine farmers plant noble varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinotage, Shiraz, as well as Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc and Sauvignon Blanc.

--
-- Backsberg is a family-run business. Right from the beginning, the name Backsberg had always been closely related with the family Back that has succeeded in creating fantastic wines over several generations. The special knowledge of the region and its features and capacities is not only passed on, but continuously improved and refined. Even though every generation wants to bring the vineyard Backsberg forward, owner, winemaker and the rest of the team agree that the taste of the wine lovers is the most important aspect at the end of the day.
-- Backsberg follows ‘down-to-earth’ Mentality
-- As only a few other wineries, Backsberg knows how to combine excellent premium wines with an easy accessibility. The wines of the estate are rightly renowned amongst critics due to their high quality; at the same time, they are considered as wines just wonderful to drink amongst wine lovers and connoisseurs. In fact, for almost every occasion. This is perfectly mirrored in the lived ‘down-to-earth’ mentality of Backsberg. Structure and finesse of the individual wines go hand in hand with a high level of so-called ‘drinkability’. Particularly the wide array of wines defines the winery. Especially the Bordeaux Blend Klein Babylonstoren is considered to be a typical Backsberg wine. It fulfils the high demand in taste and finesse for the wine critic, but also aims at the wine lover with its full bouquet and the fruity taste.
-- Backsberg with sustainable Cultivation
-- As one of the first wineries in South Africa, Backsberg focuses on a sustainable relationship with nature. The wines are created CO2-neutral which is unique in South Africa’s wine world. There are only three estates worldwide that can claim this. Additionally, the family Back is involved in holistic environmental protection. With programs for forestry and planting of native trees and plants, the yard significantly contributes to the preservation of the unique variety of the South African landscape. Backsberg is a wonderful example for the pioneering role that South African wine holds in many aspects.

--
-- In the national as well as international wine world,  Beyerskloof is considered as the home of South African Pinotage wines. Quite rightly so. With a wide range of Pinotage variations, the winemaker Beyers Truter and his team have made it their mission to promote South Africa’s national grape. Due to an exceptional quality with each new vintage, they succeeded in every aspect. Besides the special love for red wine, Beyerskloof also produces completely new flavours which is confirmed by the unusual rosés and white wines with parts of Pinotage on a high level. Not least due to the efforts of the winery, Pinotage strongly belongs to the canon of the wine world and therefore in the wine cellar of every ambitious gourmet.
-- Beyers Truter with Skill and Intuition
-- The winemaker Beyers Truter was the first South African winemaker to be awarded as the Winemaker of the Year by the judges of the International Wine and Spirit Competition. The uncrowned ‘King of Pinotage’ studied at the Stellenbosch University and therefore has the required knowledge about the area to have constant success. Skill and a fine sense for the right grape varieties and combinations have brought him and his wines numerous awards. He is also the founder of the Pinotage Association that has the aim to push the vine Pinotage even further through detailed studies and courage to experiment. Meanwhile, his son Anri followed in his footsteps and is responsible as winemaker.
-- The Winery with that certain Something
-- Everyone who has visited the estate Beyerskloof knows that there is a special atmosphere here. The beautiful and breathtaking view of the surrounding landscape is just one reason for the special experience on the yard. Every team member, from the Tasting Room staff up to the winemaker himself just radiates reputable serenity that is simply contagious. In a calm but contemplative environment, you can enjoy with all your senses and relax.

--
-- The estate Blaauwklippen has gained international fame especially with its successful variations of the grape variety Zinfandel. Wine lovers can find a whole array of different premium wines from this grape variety - from strong red up to sweet dessert wines up to the first ‘white’ Zinfandel from South Africa altogether. They are all of an exceptionally high quality and were able to win international awards several times. Blaauwklippen pursues a simple but successful strategy in wine production. The flavour of the product is primarily decided on the wine slope itself. Only rarely the winemaker Rolf Zeitvogeland his team intervene with cellar techniques to change aromas and flavours. The team regards itself as pure catalyst that allows the natural taste of each grape variety to be expressed.
-- Rolf Zeitvogel – the German in South Africa
-- Rolf Zeitvogel works as a Cellar Master and managing director at Blaauwklippen. The passionate amateur chef did not just find a job in wine production, but his true calling. After his studies, he gained experience at such renowned South African estates such as Bergelder, the KWV and Buitenverwachting. After a quick return to his home country, he was drawn back to South Africa again where he and the team as passionate as himself stand for the continuous success of Blaauwklippen.
-- Glorious History with Passion and Dedication
-- Blaauwklippen is one of the oldest wineries of the country. For more than three hundred years, winemakers have been producing South African wines on the highest level here. The estate is also one of the founding members of the Stellenbosch Wine Route which is an integral part for every enthusiastic wine tourist in South Africa. The customer has always been the main focus of Blaauwklippen. For example, the Blaauwklippen Blending Competition was the first and still is the only competition in South Africa that is not aimed at producers but directly at the gourmet.

It used to be a part of the first winery at the Cape which was founded by Simon van der Stel – the first governor of the new Dutch colony – at the end of the 17th century.
-- Buitenverwachting is a true jewel in the South African Winelands. A wide avenue leads to the Cape Dutch manor house from 1796; forming a square around a giant cedar together with the old wine cellar, the carriage shed and the bachelor house. In 1980, the Hamburg couple Richard and Christine Müller purchased the historic estate and restored it with much love for detail. From the start, it was clear that it was not just about to help the architectural jewel to shine in new splendour but to also revive the wine cultivation. The hard work paid off quickly, and in 1985, the couple had their maiden harvest, the first in 30 years for Buitenverwachting! Today their son, Lars Maack, runs the estate.
-- Culinary Delights at Buitenverwachting
-- The restaurant at Buitenverwachting belongs to the best in South Africa. A historic whitewashed and thatched building invites visitors to linger. The Cape Dutch style keeps the long tradition of the estate alive. The visitors can enjoy a wonderful view of the vineyards and the picturesque Constantia Mountains which are part of the Table Mountain range. Here, they can treat themselves with culinary delights. Besides the restaurant, the new café Coffee Bloc offers excellent coffee specialities, delicious cakes and exquisite pastry.
-- First Class Wines
-- The owner of Buitenverwachting, Lars Maack and the Winemaker Chris Paton have decided to bring their red wines to the top, besides their high quality white wines – a demanding endeavour in which they definitely have succeeded. The wines of the estate enjoy an outstanding reputation worldwide – the Sauvignon Blanc has been at the top of the South African wine producers and the wine ‘Christine’, created according to characteristically French style, is a true classic from the Cape.
-- The vines grow in deep, decomposed granite soils and mild sea breezes give the required refreshment and the grapes thrive on southeast facing vineyards at an altitude of approximately up to 250 metres above sea level. Due to the excellent climate and the soil conditions at Buitenverwachting, top wines with a high complexity and unique aromatic profiles can be created.

--
-- The roots of Constantia Uitsig reach back to the beginnings of South African wine cultivation when Simon van der Stel founded his farm in Constantia. Nowadays, Constantia Uitsig belongs to a handful of selected wineries that constitute the Constantia Valley Wine Route and is not only aware of its long history and tradition but also takes pride in it. This also shines through in the winery’s philosophy: rooted in the past, Constantia Uitsig sees itself as a haven from the present and as a gift for the future. The aspect of sustainability is therefore a major part of this winery – in order to preserve nature’s variety for the coming generations.
-- Constantia Uitsig Is Dedicated to Nature and Society
-- The winery also takes its social responsibility very seriously and supports various projects with a foundation: particularly projects that promote early childhood development or the protection of species, for example. Additionally, Constantia Uitsig is a member of the Biodiversity &amp; Wine Initiative (BWI) and strives to grow non-indigenous plants as little as possible on the farm. The wood from trees that were felled for that reason is incorporated into building alterations as well as the timber beams that are found on the area. The work on the vineyard is supposed to be as natural as possible. Flowers create variety, colour and attract several insects. These are not the only animals on the estate: there are several areas of water where indigenous birds are hoped to settle which can also be found on the new labels of the wine bottles.
-- Constantia Uitsig Focuses On World-Class White Wines
-- The team of Constantia Uitsig not only wants to preserve nature’s beauty but also share it with the visitors of the winery. A Bike Park offers cycling fun for cycling enthusiasts of every age. In the new restaurant ‘Open Door’, the doors are literally open. It is here where the great wines can be tasted. The focus of the estate is on wines that express their terroir of decomposed granite and sandstone soils close to False Bay. Since Constantia Uitsig is the farm that is situated at the lowest altitude in the valley, the soils of the 32 hectares that are currently cultivated with vines are mainly suited for world-class white wines such as Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. Additionally, there is a red blend, the Red Horizon, and a dessert wine, the Red Muscat d’Alexandrie, in the portfolio of Constantia Uitsig with which the winery contributes to the great reputation and the identity of the region.

This makes the Creation Reserve Chardonnay a fresh and sophisticated white wine that stays in the gourmet’s memory long after the last sip.''','''Creation – Pioneering Spirit in the Hemel en Aarde Valley
--
-- When Jean-Claude and Carolyn Martin established the winery in 2002, they did so with courage and conviction: on the 50 hectares of the Hemel-en-Aarde Ridge, 350 metres above sea level in the Walker Bay region alongside the Hermanus Wine Route, no vines were ever planted before. However, the owners discovered the great potential: the old weathered clay, silt and slate soils as well as the cool breeze from the Atlantic Ocean make for grapes of an outstanding quality and complex wines with a beautiful depth. The relationship with nature is an important element of Creation’s philosophy. The winery is a member of the Biodiversity &amp; Wine Initiative and plants its vines in harmony with nature. Creation has even received the international seal of EnviroWines for the environmentally friendly cultivation – one of only nine wineries in South Africa.
-- Creation - Successful Symbiosis of Old and New World
-- ‘Emphasize the beauty of nature’ is the motto from Jean-Claude Martin who is not only the owner of the estate but, being a winemaker, also works in the state-of-the-art wine cellar of Creation himself whilst interfering as little as possible into the natural maturation process of the wine. At only 14 years old, Jean-Claude knew he wanted to become a winemaker. He grew up on the family winery in Switzerland, studied wine cultivation and created his first very own wine in 1996 in a small village in a converted garage. The outcome was so impressive that as a result, he became the manager of the Grillette estate in Neuchâtel. His wife Carolyn was born in Swartland; her family is also a traditional winemaking family. Her father Walter Finlayson is considered to be one of the wine pioneers at the Cape. It is not only the family aspect where Carolyn and Jean-Claude combine the Old and the New World – their wine creations do the same with their freshness, elegance and intense fruit notes. Jean-Claude and Carolyn also have the pioneering spirit in them: within only a few years (the first harvest took place in 2006), they built up an innovative winery from nothing, making Creation the first winery to cultivate Grenache in the Hemel en Aarde Valley and bottling a single-variety Viognier.
-- Outstanding Wines and Excellent Food Pairings at Creation
-- The unique terroir is mirrored in the Art of Creation collection as well as in the Creation Reserve range and the Creation range and makes for balanced, elegant and sophisticated wines. Both wines of the Art of Creation range are only available in a limited amount and they originate – as some other wines from Creation – from a single vineyard. The red wines are all developed in barriques and are ready to be enjoyed at an early stage. There is one thing all collections and wines from Creation have in common: they are excellent, harmonious and inherently consistent compositions.Another culinary highlight and central focus of the winery is the Wine and Food Pairing. Creation was even awarded with the Klink Wine Tourism Award for the best Food and Wine Pairings. Fairly famous is the Tapas Pairing with seven artfully prepared delicacies that promises a feast for the senses just as the Wine &amp; Chocolate Pairing or the Kiss and Tell Pairing during which three Pinot Noirs and three Chardonnays are tasted with six perfectly attuned dishes. Very exciting is the Three Course Pairing Menu as every week, the chefs in the kitchen let their creativity run wild and surprise you with unexpected combinations of dishes and wines. If you don’t want to miss out on these treats, you should be quick and book beforehand – the Wine and Food Pairings at Creation are usually fully booked long before.

--
-- The family Sauer runs the winery Kanonkop in the fourth generation by now. Originally, J W Sauer, a cabinet minister of the South African parliament, had bought it. His son Paul Oliver Sauer took over later, supported by the rugby legend Jan ‘Boland’ Coetzee. In 1980, the now-famous winemaker Beyers Truter joined the team and led Kanonkop to the top of South African wine producers. Today, mostly Abrie Beeslaar plays a great role in the constant success of the winery. By the way, the name Kanonkop goes back to ‘kopje’ which means ‘small hill’. From this hill, a canon used to be fired when merchant ships arrived in the close-by bay. This shot informed the people living in the inland and they loaded their carts, went to the harbour and offered their goods for sale.
-- More than just a Workplace – Kanonkop as Home
-- Not only the family Sauer considers the estate Kanonkop as their home. The majority of employees also live on the site which has a nursery, sport grounds for cricket and football as well as schools that are close by. The staff of Kanonkop benefits directly of the success which is why their work is more than just a simple job for them. With great passion and love for detail, they make for excellent wine for many years now.
-- One of the best Producers in South Africa
-- Through continuous work on the wine slope and in the wine cellar, Kanonkop has rightly acquired the reputation of being one of the best wineries in South Africa. For many years, excellent wines have been produced here that excite connoisseurs worldwide with their consistently high quality. Early on, the estate has experimented with the grape variety Pinotage, the country’s national grape and South Africa’s successful contribution to the international wine world. It has thus quite early laid the foundation for the especially high quality Pinotage wines from Kanonkop. The grape with all its advantages comes to full effect as it unites the robustness of Cinsault with the noble and fruity character of Pinot Noir.

--
-- Ken Forrester has made the grape variety Chenin Blanc to his forte. And his wines out of it are a true pleasure for all senses. The Icon Range stands for ultimate premium quality. Especially the Forrester Meinert Chenin, FMC in short, is the flagship of Ken Forrester. Not for nothing, the estate is therefore known as the ‘Home of Chenin’ in the South African wine industry. Yet also the wines from the other noble grapes offer a great taste experience. When you are on the estate and have the chance to speak to Ken Forrester himself, just take it. We have yet to meet another vintner who speaks with the same love and pride about his wines than Ken does. Ken Forresters happy, uncomplicated and above all sometimes hilarious nature is always worth a stay at the winery.
-- The Winery Ken Forrester
-- Ken Forrester is located in the region Stellenbosch on the slopes of the Helderberg Mountains. On a cultivation area of more than 40 hectares, the winemakers plant noble vines such as Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin Blanc and also Cabernet Sauvignon. The pleasant atmosphere in the Tasting Room with a view of the unique landscape with its vineyards truly invites visitors to try one or more glasses of the high quality wine. Close to the estate there is the noble restaurant 96 Winery Road. It offers noble dishes and the fantastic wines of Ken Forrester.
-- Ken Forrester – Pioneer of the Wine World of South Africa
-- Ken Forrester has had many previous owners but only today’s made the winery achieve its current splendour. The family of Ken Forrester purchased the estate in 1993 and found a new home there.
